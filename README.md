# Flowers Prediction System
## Introduction 

This project uses machine learning techniques to identify two common types of flowers: Rose and Sunflower. By using your device's camera, the system analyzes images in real-time and provides an accurate prediction of the flower type. Users can take advantage of this technology to easily identify flower types, whether in a garden or in pictures.
## Key Features
- High accuracy in flower type recognition.
- A counter to track the number of discoveries.
- Easy reset option for the counter.
## How It Works
- Launch the camera by clicking the "Start Prediction" button.
- The system will analyze the images and display the flower's name along with the prediction confidence percentage.
- The counter is updated with each new discovery.
- To reset the counter, click the "Reset Counter" button.
